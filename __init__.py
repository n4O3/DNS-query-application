"""This python package is realized in the framework of the SAÃ©15, Processing Data, project of the BUT1 - Networks and Telecommunications. Its objective is to provide tools to query a DNS server :

* Form the DNS packets of the requests according to the recommendations of the RFC 1035 ; 
* Process the data received in the DNS response frame.

The RFC1035 describes the details of the domain system and protocol.

All communications inside of the domain protocol are carried in a single
format called a message.  The top level format of message is divided
into 5 sections (some of which are empty in certain cases).

Message format

+------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Header     | fields that specify which of the remaining sections    |
| 12 bytes   | are present and the message properties                 |

| Question   | the question for the name server                       |

| Answer     | RRs answering the question                             |
